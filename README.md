# PyBlock

Blockchain Exposure:

* Blockchain: an immutable, sequential chain of records called blocks. They are transactions chained together using hashes. 

* Hash: a function that takes in input value, and from that creates an output value deterministic of the input value. For any x input value, you will always receive the same y output whenever the hash function is run. In this way, every input has a determined output.

* Immutability: each new block is contains the hash of the previous block giving the blockchain immutability. If a block is corrupted all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.

* Genesis Block: block with no predecessors
